![Banner Girls Frontline](./gflBan.jpg)

# English
This is a rules hack for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) that adapts the mechanics of [Edge Studio's](https://edge-studio.net/) Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition to the near-future sci-fi setting of Girls Frontline. Players take on the roles of Tactical Dolls - advanced androids designed for combat against mechanical threats in a world ravaged by war.

This is a fan-made adaptation and not officially endorsed by Edge Studio or the Girls Frontline developers. All original L5R texts, images, and copyrights remain the property of their respective owners.

## Setting Overview
In the GFL5R universe, humanity has been driven to the brink by the Sangvis Ferri uprising. Tactical Dolls, sentient androids programmed for warfare, fight to reclaim the world. Drawing from the spiritual and mechanical themes of both settings, this hack blends the honor-bound samurai code with cybernetic enhancements and tactical combat.
